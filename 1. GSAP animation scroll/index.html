                    <p>I remember when I was a young boy I loved painting, drawing and doodling, and I was pretty good at it. I would craft various objects from wooden branches, like toys, and share them with my friends. Or I remeber in school I would make an improvised comic book with a fictional character and share it with my classmates.  </p>

                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p>I never really though about an artistic career. I didn’t grow up dreaming about it. But it all started to change, when on my 14th birthday my girlfriend gave me a gift - a huge canvas, set of oil paints and some brushes. Since then, I loved painting as a process that gives me joy in life. I think I was motivated by the desire to to express myself and communicate my ideas.</p>

                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p>As the number of paintings in my collection grew, I was thinking more of pursuing the career of a painter. I even persuaded my parents to pay for private art lessons I took, to prepare my portfolio. At this same time I realised that fine art as a subject requires a certain formlisation of your work, which I didn’t like. As a result, I made a compromise and decided to go study Product Design instead.</p>

                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p>Even though I didn’t become a painter, it did taught me a lot. I learned how to be patient, how to slowly build up the knowledge and improve the craft. It sparked my interest in design, and later, in creative computing technologies.Also, I have met some very nice and interesting people through sharing my art. I still keep all of my paintings, and I will share one of their stories with you today.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p> At the time when I was making the painting I was moving in-between cities and countries, and I had some anxieties regarding the future and I was still growing up. The character was inspired by the idea of a super-human, or Nietsze’s idea of uber-human, but this charcater is also cursed at the same time and is trying to heal. I wrote a mini-story about it when I was making the skecthes.</p>

                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p>I usually like to paint intuitively, with a lot of expression and fast movements. This painting was different as I had a sketch and I followed a certain idea in mind, but I still started it out from these abstract shapes, that helped me to further build character detail’s, without being overly constrained by the proportions. </p>

                <div class="p_cont">
                    <p>I think the color scheme and color balance are really essential elements of this work, as at the time I also had very good oil paints, and I had different shades of a hue. That helped me to really build more depth and help create a sort of 3D effect with my character.</p>

                    <p>I really liked how this one turned out, it has some expression but at the same time you can clearly see the key shapes and get the main idea of the work. I still keep the painting in my room, where I live, and I am moving it with me every time I have to switch the accommodation. It serves as a reminder for me about the times when this painting was made.</p>

                    <p>Wrapping up, my paintings are an important part of my identity, and even though I am doing computing now I am still grateful that I learned the skill and pursuaded to study the creative field. I feel like it really shaped me in a positive way, and made me better in many ways as an individual.</p>
